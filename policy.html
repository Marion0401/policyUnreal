    EPIC GAMES PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: August 30, 2022.

Welcome to NetworkProject!


This privacy policy describes the different ways we may collect, use, and share information on, through, or in connection with the service.


1. WHAT ARE THE SERVICES?
We use the term “ Services” to describe any products or services that directly link to this privacy policy. These include, for example:

Network Project including the Developer Portal and Unreal Engine.
Note that your use of the Services may also be subject to additional terms and conditions. For example, you must review and accept the Fortnite End User License Agreement (link) to play Fortnite, the Psyonix Terms of Use (link) to play Rocket League, and the Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout – End User License Agreement (link) to play Fall Guys.

Please read this entire privacy policy. You should also carefully review any other agreements that apply to the  Services you use, and confirm you understand and agree to them, before using those products or services.
 

2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
The types of information we collect depend on how you interact with us. Generally speaking, we collect information in three main ways: A) when you provide it to us, B) automatically when you use the  Services, and C) from service providers and third parties.

          A. Information You Provide
You can provide us with different kinds of information depending on how you interact with the Services. Sometimes we’ll ask you to provide specific pieces of information, such as when we require it to provide parts of the  Services to you (for example, by prompting you to complete an online registration process). If we ask you to provide us with information in these cases and you choose not to, you may not be able to access the relevant Epic Services and/or some features may not operate as intended.

For instance, in order to make purchases on the  and to play some of our games, you’ll need an account. To create one, you’ll need to provide us with basic registration information like your name, a public-facing display name, password, the country you live in, and email address. If you want to make a purchase, we may ask you to provide payment-related information (like your credit card number and expiration date) to complete the transaction.

We also collect the information you voluntarily provide to sign up for email alerts, use social features like forums or chat, register for early access to our games, use our developer tools (including to create and publish games and other content), complete surveys, or contact us through Player Support requests or customer service. If you enter a contest or competitive event, or participate in our Support-A-Creator program, we’ll collect your application information and other information we may need to help confirm your eligibility and process payouts. We collect whatever information you choose to provide to us in those or other similar cases.

         B. Information We Collect Automatically
We collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or use the  Services. This includes information about your gameplay or application usage, purchases, entitlements, and other activity in the  Services, typically associated with your account (if you are logged into your  account or use a third-party account to access the  Services) or with an identifier we have assigned to your device or profile. While the specific types of information that we automatically collect may vary, they generally include:

Usage information and statistics about how you interact with the  Services, including the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, gameplay attempts, progression and results, saved preferences, crash reports, the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, and platform type;
Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access our services, such as IP address, device identifiers, your internet service provider, plugins, or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system-related specifications); and
The general location of your device, which we typically derive from your device’s IP address.
The  Services use technologies such as cookies, log files, and web beacons to automatically collect the types of information listed above. Some of these technologies may create small files or record-keeping tools that may be stored on your device. They help us, our service providers, and third parties recognize your device and provide information about how you use and interact with the Services. For example, they support our ability to  authenticate users, remember preferences, manage advertising, personalize experiences, and conduct data analytics.

Please note that if certain features on the  Services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the  Services or others’ websites over time. These features are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.

         C. Information We Collect from Other 
In some cases, we may also receive information about you from service providers and third parties in connection with your use of the  Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.

For example, some other developers allow you to use your  account to log in to their service. And if you choose to link your account with your account on a third-party social media (like Facebook), gaming (like Steam), or other similar website or service, or if you interact with an ad for one of the Services on an external website or service, the company that operates that website or service may share some information with Epic in accordance with their own privacy practices. Your privacy settings on the other company’s website or service typically control the specific types of information they can share with Epic, so please be sure to review and update them regularly. Common examples for linked accounts might include your third-party account display name and user ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address. For participants in our Support-a-Creator program, we may also collect the number of social media account followers you have for program eligibility purposes.

You can also buy, download, or access some  Services on or through services operated by third parties. If you do, they may provide us with information to facilitate your access to and use of the  Services. This typically includes information like your display name, user ID, and device and region information. For example, you can choose to download and play games like Fortnite on gaming consoles (like PlayStation®, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Switch) through your gaming console account. When you do, the company operating that platform or service may share some information with us, which helps us do things like facilitate your gameplay and track your progression and entitlements.

         D. Fraud Prevention & Anti-Cheat
Providing users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the  Services is extremely important to us. We strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Services. We use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity. These services may collect and analyze data about your computer and the software on your computer to detect cheating and may be provided by Epic or by service providers such as BattlEye.
 

3. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?
As a general matter, we use the information we collect (either individually or in combination with other information collected as described in this policy) to help us provide, improve, customize, analyze, and promote the Services.

This includes using it for purposes such as:

Creating, verifying, and managing user accounts and features;
Providing the  Services, as well as support and assistance for them, including by responding to inquiries, processing transactions or requests, and communicating with users (such as by sending service and account-related messages and updates);
Developing, delivering, and improving the  Services and other offerings, some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties;
Personalizing your experience, including by presenting content or features better tailored to you or your interests, or our inferences about your interests (for instance, if you frequently play games in a certain genre, we may infer that you’d be interested in that genre and suggest similar games to you);
Promoting the  Services, including managing, customizing, and measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements, promotional offers, surveys, and events;
Managing alpha, beta, or early access tests (and collecting feedback);
Conducting data analytics (like analyzing how the  Services are used so we can better understand, improve, and personalize them);
Complying with our legal or contractual obligations and enforcing our terms; and
Securing the  Services, such as by detecting fraud and otherwise protecting  and other users from illegal or harmful actions.
We may also process information that does not identify you individually, including aggregate or de-identified information that we create or collect from other sources. This information helps us better understand larger groups of users. If we combine this information with information that identifies you, we will treat it as described in this privacy policy. But please note that this privacy policy does not restrict our ability to process information that does not individually identify you, and we may use and disclose aggregated or de-identified information for any reason permitted by law.
 

4. HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?
We may share some of the information we collect to help operate and improve the  Services. Depending on how you interact with us, common examples might include sharing:

With console and platform partners (for example, to facilitate gameplay when you access the  Services through a third-party console provider);
With other game developers (such as to enable features for games you acquire through the Games Store);
With other users (like if you use social features such as chat);
Publicly (for example, your display name, content you create or share, basic game statistics, and other similar information may be generally accessible to others);
With service providers that operate on our behalf to help support the  Services in accordance with our instructions (for example, cloud storage providers, payment processors, or marketing and advertising partners);

With other  entities (including to help provide support for the  Services internationally);
In connection with certain types of corporate transactions (like in the event of a restructuring or the sale of all or a significant part of our business); and
With your permission (for example, if you link external accounts with your  account, or use your  account to sign in to third-party games and services or participate in cross-promotional events).
We may also share information that does not identify you with third parties, including aggregate or de-identified information.
Third parties you interact with through  Services may have different privacy practices than , so we encourage you to review their privacy policies before sharing your information with them.
 

5. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The  Services are intended to be appropriate for general audiences and are not directed to children (usually considered to be under 13, depending on where you reside).  does not intentionally collect personal information from children without seeking any required parental approval in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, such as the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

We may ask you to provide age-related information in order to help us comply with laws like COPPA. For example, we may request your date of birth to determine whether COPPA requires us to obtain verifiable parental consent from your parent or guardian before allowing you to access the  Services. If a user indicates they are a COPPA minor, we’ll require that user to complete a parental approval process before continuing to access the relevant  Services. This process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to the  Services, inform them about privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve collection and use of their child’s information as described in this policy, and describe the controls that we make available to them.

Once a parent provides their consent, we’ll give them an opportunity to review and change important account settings that control how their child can interact with the  Services. To learn more, see https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/parental-controls. Parents are also generally free to change or revoke the choices they’ve previously made, and can review the personal information associated with their child’s account or request that we delete it from our systems. To submit these requests or ask us any other questions you may have about how we handle your child’s personal information, please see “Contact Us” below.

Authorized child accounts are otherwise treated much like other  accounts unless the settings are adjusted through the parental controls available at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/parental-controls. They can generally play approved games (such as Fortnite, Rocket League, or Fall Guys), access communications and social features (like chat and friends lists), and freely interact with most of the  Services (including downloading other games from the  Games Store). For additional details, please see “What Information Do We Collect?”, “How Do We Use Information?”, and “How Do We Share Information?” above.

SuperAwesome & Kids Web Services

The  Services use Kids Web Services (“KWS”) for parental and guardian verification purposes. KWS is a service focused on children’s safety that is offered by our subsidiary SuperAwesome.
